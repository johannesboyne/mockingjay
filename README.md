### Mockingjay

A simple local development setup to simulate AWS Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB executions.

- DynamoDB Local: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Tools.html
- S3 Local: https://github.com/jubos/fake-s3
- API Gateway & Lamdba Runner: `awsservices.js` (this initializes the local dynamoDB and s3 servers as well!)
